            question: 'Is dental treatment in Albania safe?',
            answer: 'Absolutely. Our clinic meets all European Union standards for dental care. We use EU-certified materials, follow strict sterilization protocols (EN 13060 Class B), and our dentists are internationally trained with years of experience treating patients from Western Europe. We maintain the same standards you would expect in the UK, Germany, or Italy.'

            category: 'Cost',
            icon: Euro,
            question: 'Why are treatments so much cheaper in Albania?',
            answer: 'The lower cost of living in Albania allows us to offer the same quality materials and expertise at 50-70% lower prices. Our dentists use the same premium European materials (German implants, Italian ceramics) as Western clinics, but our overhead costs - rent, staff salaries, operational expenses - are significantly lower. You benefit from these savings without any compromise on quality.'

We optimize your treatment schedule to minimize your time away from home while ensuring proper healing and quality results.'

            category: 'Warranty',
